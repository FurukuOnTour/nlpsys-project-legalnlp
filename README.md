## Our Approach/Methodology/Model 
Explain your model here how it works.

## Dataset
- We using raw data judged and publish by The Supreme Court of Thailand.
- We labeled them up to the favorbility for the plaintiff in each case by human annotator, using Datasuar.ai as a tool for annotation.
- All data will only be labeled just one between these favorbility; Favorable: if the judgement favor plaintiff and they compensation and amount of accurseds from the start are approve and unchange by the court, Patial Favorable: if the judgement favor plaintiff but they compensation or amount of accurseds from the start are changed by the court judgement, Unfavorable: if the case has been withdrawn by the court, and Others: if the case are decide to rejudge, or the court withdrawn plaintiff accusation because of legal reasons (like lack of evidence, or claim prescibed).
- after cleaning data, our total data set is 375 tokens, 137 tokens is partially favorable, 111 tokens is unfavorable, 84 tokens is favorable, and last 43 is other. Then, we devide them into training set and develop set by 80:20 (which make tokens in traing set become 300 while dev set is 75)

| Label | Frequency |
|--------|----------|
| partially favorable | 36.5333 % |
| unfavorable | 29.6000 % |
| favorable | 22.4000 % |
| other | 11.4667 % |

## Experiment setup
First, we start training Conditonal Random Field (CRF) model using modify train and dev set (we change label to plain and verdict instead of favorbility) that we prepare for training and evaluation. We done this step to create a model that could help us automatically labeled where the verdict is in raw data.

Second, we train and compete the result to find the best classifier model that could predict favorblility with most accuracy (F1) using full court record (contain both plain and verdict) as an input. In this process, we intend to train a model that could annotate favorbility instead of human annonator. We try 3 different model for our candidate; Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and BERT (we use WangchanBERTa as a base for this task).
    
Third, we train and compete the result to find the best classifier model that could predict favorblility with most accuracy (F1) using only case's plain as an input. We also the same try 3 different model for our candidate with unchange parameter tuning; Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Thai National Corpus word embedding, and BERT (we use WangchanBERTa as a base for this task). 

Both task use the same parameter and word embedding in the table under this paragragh. Both CNN and BERT use around 5-7 minute for training.

| CNN | WangchanBERTa |
|----------|---------------|
| filters = 150 | learning_rate=3e-5 |
| kernel_size = 45 | per_device_train_batch_size=96 |
| hidden_dims = 150 | per_device_eval_batch_size=96 |
| 100-unit TNC word embedding | num_train_epochs=90 |
| max word len = 600 | drop_out = 0.4 |
